A friend of mine recently went to the US to pursue his Masters degree, and he has asked me to help him decide between 3 phones:

[Samsung Infuse 4G](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SGH-I997ZKAATT), [HTC Inspire 4G](http://www.htc.com/us/products/inspire-att) and [Apple iPhone 4](http://www.apple.com/iphone/design/).

I used the internet to quickly compare the phones and had to suggest Samsung Infuse 4G. Here’s my response:

- Between Samsung Infuse 4G and HTC Inspire 4G, [go for Samsung Infuse](http://www.compare-cellphones.org/Samsung-Infuse-4G-vs-HTC-Inspire-4G). Except maybe for looks, or the UI. HTC has Sense UI where as Samsung has TouchWiz UI. I personally like TouchWiz. Check some YouTube videos to get a better idea.
- Between Samsung Infuse 4G and iPhone 4, [go with Samsung Infuse 4G](http://www.compare-cellphones.org/Samsung-Infuse-4G-vs-Apple-iPhone-4). The pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. But since you already have the iPad, having an iPhone will give you a more integrated experience. But think about Bluetooth file transfer. On an iPhone, you can’t transfer files through Bluetooth to other brand phones, only to an iPhone.
- Between HTC Inspire 4G and iPhone 4, go with whatever you like, [according to your preferences](http://www.compare-cellphones.org/HTC-Inspire-4G-vs-Apple-iPhone-4).

All in all, if you ask me, you should disregard the HTC Inspire 4G altogether. Samsung Infuse 4G is the overall winner, but if you want the Apple experience, go with the iPhone. Just remember that Samsung Infuse will come with Froyo (Android 2.2), not the latest Android version Gingerbread (Android 2.3). But apparently, [Gingerbread for Infuse 4G is on its way](http://phandroid.com/2011/08/12/att-samsung-infuse-4g-will-receive-gingerbread-update-this-month), so it shouldn’t be an issue.

Remember that I have not checked detailed reviews of each phone. If you __really__ want to know your phone before you buy it, you should read through detailed reviews:
- [Detailed review of Samsung Infuse 4G](http://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Samsung-Infuse-4G-Review_id2733)
- [Detailed review of HTC Inspire 4G](http://www.phonearena.com/reviews/HTC-Inspire-4G-Review_id2661)
- [Detailed review of iPhone 4](http://www.phonearena.com/reviews/Apple-iPhone-4-Review_id2463)

Look for reviews on YouTube if you don’t feel like reading. Let me know what you’ve decided :)

PS: In those comparisons, disregard the “More Apps Available” factor, because it honestly shouldn’t make a difference to you between Apple’s 350K apps vs Android’s 270K apps. The important and most useful apps are covered in both the platforms. If you ask me, Apple probably has more [redundant and useless apps which actually cost money](http://www.heartlessdoll.com/2009/02/10_absolutely_useless_iphone_apps_that_made_someon.php)
