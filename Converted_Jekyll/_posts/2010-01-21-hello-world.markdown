And thus I extend my existence into the internet! I made this blog so that all my half-baked experiments and experiences are preserved. This will hopefully help me achieve a sense of satisfaction when I work on something, because now, it will at least make it to the blog if nothing else.

I always find myself worrying about unnecessary details without focusing on the real thing. For instance, as I type this, my habit compels me to get to the dashboard and customize this blog, but no! This time, I'll focus on the content, so here are the posts I'm about to make:

1.  The new brains for my beloved machine
2.  Xbox 360 Controller for Windows: The supplement to my gaming experience
3.  Windows 7: The best Windows yet

See you soon!
