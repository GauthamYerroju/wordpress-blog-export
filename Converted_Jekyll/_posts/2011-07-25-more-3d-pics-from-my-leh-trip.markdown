Remember my post about [Stereoscopic 3D](http://gtmstechblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/stereoscopic-vision/)? I have processed more such photos on the occasion of my family trip to [Leh, Ladakh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leh). Use your typical red-blue 3D glasses to view:

If I had known they’d turn out so great, I would have made time to take more pictures. To see how 3D works and how one might make 3D photos, refer to my post about stereoscopic vision. And I compel you to use Google and Youtube for really good tutorials.

Until next time folks.
