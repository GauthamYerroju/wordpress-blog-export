So what’s the deal with Mozilla? I know they’ve changed to a rapid release cycle, but it doesn’t feel like it was too long ago that version 4 was released. Soon after, version 5 didn’t bring any groundbreaking changes to the table either. Now, they’ve released version 6.

Judging from FF6’s release notes, most of the changes are under the hood:

> The latest version of Firefox has the following changes:
>     
>   * The address bar now highlights the domain of the website you're visiting 
>   * Streamlined the look of the [site identity block](http://blog.margaretleibovic.com/post/4769940235/identity-block-uplift)
>   * Added support for the latest draft version of WebSockets with a [prefixed API](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=659324)
>   * Added support for [EventSource / server-sent events](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/06/a-wall-powered-by-eventsource-and-server-sent-events/)
>   * Added support for [window.matchMedia](http://dbaron.org/log/20110422-matchMedia)
>   * Added [Scratchpad](http://antennasoft.net/robcee/2011/06/08/scratchpad-canvas-demo/), an interactive JavaScript prototyping environment 
>   * Added a new Web Developer menu item and moved development-related items into it 
>   * Improved usability of the [Web Console](http://blog.mozilla.com/devtools/2011/05/28/web-console-where-you-want-it-to-be-with-nicer-completion-and-more/)
>   * Improved the discoverability of Firefox Sync 
>   * Reduced browser startup time when using Panorama 
>   * Fixed several stability issues 
>   * Fixed several [security issues](http://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox.html#firefox6)

I’m used to seeing major changes or overhauls with an increase in version number by 1\. Oh well. I hope by the time FF reaches it’s double digit version, it’ll be different from FF6.

You can download Firefox 6 from the official website, if your browser hasn’t already prompted you to update. One word of caution though. Remember when some of your add-ons were rendered useless with the update from 3.6 to 4? I don’t expect more add-ons to be unsupported, because versions 4, 5 and 6 are similar, but watch out.

Until next time.
