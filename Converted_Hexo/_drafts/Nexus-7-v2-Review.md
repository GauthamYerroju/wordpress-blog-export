I've always wanted a tablet, but I could never justify spending dough on a tablet when I had my Nexus 5\. Then one fine day, I got gifted a Nexus 7 2013 edition tablet, by my dear uncle!

Uncle, you've always had a knack for giving the most thoughtful gifts, a hearty thanks and shout out to you! :)

We're well past 2013 and the Nexus 7 v2 may seem a little old, but today, I'll try and prove to you that it still packs a punch! I've had the tab for a while now and I wanted to review it since day one, but I never got around to it. But this gave me the opportunity to truly get a feel for the device in everyday usage. Now, on with the review.

Physical construction and design.

The first thing you notice when you hold an N7 is the gorgeous soft touch velvet body. It is very nice to the touch and doesn't attract fingerprints as readily as other devices with plastic or glass bodies. The material isn't really slip proof, but it's much better than the likes of the Galaxy S3 that I used to own and inspires a level of confidence and comfort when you hold it. Of course, the Nexus 5 ended up following the same design language, and I'm happy about it because both the Nexus devices are a treat to hold. The feeling is outdone probably only by the HTC One's metal body.

Weighing 290 grams, it's pretty comfortable to hold. For a tablet. When I'm about to sleep and I want to catch up on my [Pocketed](https://getpocket.com) articles, I always reach out for my Nexus 5\. But for all other situations I'm pretty comfortable with the tablet's weight.

It took me a little while to get used to the size of the tablet. Having messed around with an iPad 2 before, the N7 felt too small to me at first. But once I got it through my head that this tab is designed for one-handed usage (as much as a tab can allow), I felt myself really enjoying the form factor and size. It kinda fits in one hand and you can use the other hand to do whatever you need to do very efficiently.

The volume and lock buttons felt weird at first, as they are on the surface which angles backward. I used to try pressing them from the side, as I'm used to doing with smart phones, but for the Nexus 7 they need to be pressed slightly from the bottom. I'm not sure I've explained it right, but basically, you'll have to figure out the angle.
When I used the tab in landscape, a few things immediately became apparent.
1, the extra dead space at the top and bottom of the tab (or to the sides in landscape) keep hands from obscuring the screen, and provide some room to grip the tablet properly, which is awesome.
2, the speaker amplitude from the left and right speakers is not symmetrical! I still can't figure out if it's just me but whatever be the case, I find it _very_ distracting. I'd appreciate feedback from other Nexus 7 owners on this.
3, I found myself obscuring the speakers quite often. But I can't complain too much, as there aren't many devices which truly address this issue (props to HTC's [BoomSound](http://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/htc-one-m8/boomsound/)).
4, typing is a pain in landscape. The keyboard is far too wide to easily type while holding the tab with both hands, and swiping becomes a chore. In portrait though, typing is an _absolute delight_. Both the thumbs reach all keys on the keyboard without having to shift the hands while typing. Familiarity with a desktop keyboard layout translates extremely well to the touch screen in portrait mode. Honestly, it's the first time typing felt so great on a touch screen for me.
