Theming. Do it right, and it makes your PC truly your own. But what most people might not know is that it adds a bevy of functionality to the desktop, which is pretty awesome.

&nbsp;

I've themed my PC loads of times before and I've come across some really awesome tools. I had to re-install Windows after I assembled my new rig (more on that in a later post), and this time I thought I'd record my process. The format of this post is going to be very informal, it's essentially a thought dump. I may refine it after I am done or make a new post. So here goes!

Stuff I want and need to do:

*   Do this completely using free tools, no paid software.
*   Find a good visual style.
*   - DeviantArt is my go to site for this. Lots of amazing talent. But you might have to wade through a bunch of low-quality stuff as well.
*   Find a taskbar replacement.
*   Taskbar provides 4 things:

1.  Access to start menu
2.  Launcher (with actions, recents and shortcuts, through jumplists)
3.  Running task list
4.  Notification tray
5.  Show Desktop (the challenging one's going to be the peek feature)

*   - A dock should serve us well. Primary choice: Winstep Nexus Dock.
*   - Might add other docks for tray, launcher and notification area.
*   - Ideally should be the same dock, but free docks don;t provide multi-docks. I might just buy my fav. dock to makes things easier and consistent.
*   - Something like Launchy can replace the start menu completely. But it's too keyboard-dependent. Something mouse-friendly as well would be awesome.
*   Extras
*   - Things I come across and think are useful.
*   - Aura: http://aura.codeplex.com/
*   - Circular docks which are not really "docked". Good looking anytime-anywhere launchers. Contenders are Circle Dock and Slider Dock.
*   - Logon Screen Changer: http://www.danielnetsoftware.com/en-US/
*   - Boot screens. Risky but awesome.

So that's the plan.

Step 1: Find a good Visual Style.

I go to DeviantArt and find something. Tip for first time themers, search for "Visual Style 7".

The problem is that many themes are either have transparent panels, flat panels, extremely small fonts, or a combination of those things. They look pretty good, mind you, but what I;m looking for needs to be opaque (or only subtly transparent), NOT completely flat (but something with subtle tactile feeling, like Android's UI), and readable fonts and sizes. I considered the following themes:

*   APPOWS (excluded)
*   http://neiio.deviantart.com/art/APPOWS-157033415)
*   - Awesome look, has a matte tactile feel.
*   - That horrendous small font I spoke of.
*   Frost Aero (excluded)
*   http://minhtrimatrix.deviantart.com/art/Frost-Aero-176048796
*   - Excellent visibility, pleasant whites.
*   - Horrendous small font.
*   Clearscreen Sharp (HELL YEA!)
*   http://k-johnson.deviantart.com/art/Clearscreen-Sharp-for-Windows7-141360821
*   - Nice glassy look
*   - Close to stock but better
*   SLAVE (HELL YEA!)
*   http://guillendesign.deviantart.com/art/SLAVE-for-Windows-Seven-216576443
*   - One of the best skeumorphoic designs I've seen
*   - Makes for a good dark theme, with gray folder BGs instead of stark blacks, maintaining visibility.
*   Shine 2.0 (HELL YEA!)
*   http://zainadeel.deviantart.com/art/Shine-2-0-for-Windows-7-172671190
*   - Awesome frosted look
*   - Colorful window icons (close, minimize, etc.)
*   Metalik Glass (HELL YEA!)
*   http://katz93.deviantart.com/art/Metalik-Glass-for-Win7-195900759
*   - Soft frosted look
*   - LOVE the window button hover highlights!
*   - Wallpaper: http://alexander-gg.deviantart.com/art/Grungy-183292626
*   Dream (HELL YEA!)
*   http://giannisgx89.deviantart.com/art/Dream-for-Win7-206868802
*   - Similar to Metalik Glass
*   - Has nice glossy green progress bars. Very lively!
*   - Wallpaper: http://alexander-gg.deviantart.com/art/G2-187484662
*   Sonye (HELL YEA!)
*   http://giannisgx89.deviantart.com/art/Sonye-Theme-for-Win7-v2-155198766
*   - Similar to Clear Screen
*   - Nice glossy glass
*   +1 (HELL YEA!)
*   http://aaron-a-arts.deviantart.com/art/1-268398605
*   - AWESOME AWESOME theme!
*   - A very Android-like UI, colorful.
*   - Reminds me of Android's "Light theme with dark action bar".
*   - Extras: http://aaron-a-arts.deviantart.com/art/1-players-UPDATED-11-20-269566764?q=gallery%3AAaron-A-Arts%2F10308587&amp;qo=47
*
Many of the visual styles also modify some system files (to theme the back/forward buttons in explorer, start menu, etc.). A good tool to manage all this is Theme Manager (http://www.deviantart.com/art/Theme-Manager-v5-RC-6-198070004).

First, I will install Theme Manager and make TM profiles out of the above themes. This is going to involve a lot of boring work and a bunch of reboots unfortunately, but it's a one-time process and it will be worth it. I'm gonna go take a lunch break now.

Alright. So I've installed all the above themes to my C:\Windows\Resources\Themes folder and configured Theme Manager with the themed system files (explorer.exe, ExplorerFrame.exe, etc.).

Step 2: Taskbar replacement.

1\. Winstep Nexus Dock.

Perfect. It's a launcher which supports active task list as well as notification tray. I've set it to be always visible, reserve screen space at the bottom, and tweaked a few other visual settings.

Ideally, I would like to have 3 separate docks:

*   Launchers on the left
*   Active tasks in  the middle
*   Notification tray and Show Desktop on the right
So I went searching for other docks. I came across XWindows Dock, but it was too limited. I tried out Rocket Dock but it was lagging a little and when I tried it, it was not showing the running task list. But at least I can use it as a launcher, so I'll probably come back to it again.
