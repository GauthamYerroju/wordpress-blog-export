I'm back again with a post, and this time I bring some Android goodness with me! In case I haven't mentioned it before, I bought myself a Galaxy S3 (GT-I9300) and I've been pretty happy with it. When a guy like me gets a hold of an Android phone, flashing custom ROMs is an eventuality! :D

I threw warranty out the window (with 5 months still remaining) and flashed Paranoid Android 3.10, then Liquid Smooth 2.1, and I am currently running Carbon 1.6\. All in the span of one week. Life's great, ain't it? ;)

Today, I will be reviewing Carbon ROM. It's a CM10 and AOKP based ROM, forked from LiquidSmooth ROM. Before I start though, here's a few things you need to know before you waste any more time reading:

1.  This is a subjective review. Not biased, but subjective. The difference is important.
2.  I write a lot. It's a weakness. This is going to be a long post. If you, like me, love reading long posts, especially reviews, on a weekend with a bowl of popcorn, this post is dedicated to you! :) But I'll also add a summary at the bottom of the post, so scroll down there if you're a member of the Impatient Guild :P
3.  Coverage is not the point, the point is to share my experience and thoughts on the ROM. I will only be covering the features I use myself daily, and things that caught my eye. But if you need me to test out anything specific for you before you decide to flash (on GT-I9300 running Carbon v1.6), let me know and I'll be glad to help.
4.  I will mainly try to categorize all my observations into 3 sections: The Good, The Bad and Wishlist. The goal is a neat list useful for prospective users and developers of the ROM.
5.  I'll update this post as I find out new things about the ROM (a "last updated" line at the beginning of the post). But still, development is happening pretty fast, and I'll only be interested in keeping this up-to-date until a new Stable release is made. ;)

## Some Context

## The Good

1\. Dark Carbon.

2\. Enhanced Messaging app.

2\. Everything from LS, CM and AOKP.

2.1 Fine-grained auto-brightness control.

3\. Comes with default JB Launcher.

4\. Comes with a working Performance Control (-LS)

5\. 2G/3G toggle (-LS)

6\. Excellent battery life (at least as good as stock if not better).

7\. Excellent RAM management (for daily tasks, not stress-tested).

8\. Clear All button  in Recent Apps included and at the bottom too! (-LS)

## The Bad

1\. Navbar problems. Once enabled, disabling doesn't work until restart. Only the Navbar toggle in Power menu works properly.

2\. Swipe sideways for Notifications&lt;&gt;Quick Toggles only works on the bottom bar (+LS)

3\. Comes with JB stock launcher. Trebuchet Launcher would've been a better choice.

4\. Statusbar and Navbar transparency is glitchy/jumpy. (+PA)

5\. Doesn't come with a default file manager.

6\. Xposed  Installer isn't hidden (+LS)

7\. Started off at 1.6 GHz on GT-I9300\. Should've been the default 1.4 GHz

8\. Some settings are scattered / CarbonRom settings inside Carbon Links = Redundant (+LS)

8.1 Clock Widget settings are included in Carbon Settings &gt; Lockscreen &gt; Clock Widget. Better off in Date and Time, or even a dedicated menu for the Chronus widget.

9\. Pie control's "Small" trigger size doesn't seem to work.

10\. Fast Charging: Toggle included but no Settings item. Toggle doesn't seem to work.

## Wishlist

1\. Safety lock in Performance Settings

2\. Fix for camera crash on touch-to-focus with flash.

3\. Multiple trigger-areas for the PI (like LMT)

4\. Pie default theme respects the theme's main color.

5\. Recent Apps customization: distinction between running apps and recent apps.

6\. Home button torch while screen off.

7\. Meaningful names for Pie settings.

8\. Back button functionality for Notification and Quick Settings screens triggered from Pie.

9\. More interactive/realistic Quick Settings ordering (+LS)

10\. All Quick Settings toggle icons respect the theme's main color.

11\. Disable Factory Reset in default Backup &amp; reset menu.

12\. Power Saver mode.

## Uncharted Territory

1\. Tethering, regular and Wifi.

2\. CM Profiles.

3\. Dev options &gt; Power menu bug reports
